What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?
Initializing a repository creates the initial .git directory to contain
a list of all your changelogs (commits) to be used in synchronizing
with the github repo as needed. We need to use this to synchronize with
the online repo otherwise we would not be able to keep track of our progress.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area acts as a filter with which to determine what files in
the working directory get documented as a change in the commit. In this
respect the user can use the stanging area to selectively choose files
for a commit, without being limited to having the whole directory forced
to be committed. This allows for the user to not include into the repo
any unnecessary files such as test scripts and binaries which are not part
of the main program, but have been used to help debug/test the program.

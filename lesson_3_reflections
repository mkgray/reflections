When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
A remote repository offers many advantages, such as developing over multiple machines without having to transfer files the old way. Furthermore, a remote repository on the cloud improves reliability.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Manual change pulling allows you to work on a frozen instance of the program under development, such that you do not have to worry that code which you are working on is not being significantly changed constantly while you work. In this respect you can concentrate solely on your branch, and isolate the merging/compatability issues after you are ready to push/pull.

Desccribe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks: Forks are used to create your own copy of a project. Typically this is used when you want to develop your own spin-off of another project (or simply do not have access to another users project for modifying).
Clones: Cloning is to directly copy a project on GitHub to your local machine. This may directly be a project on GitHub or a project on your own account you have forked. This may also be used to clone code without adding changes to the program.
Branches: Branches are used to develop on a 'separate path' from the master or main branch (which typically is development ready at all times). The usage of branches allows us to develop features in an isolated environment without worrying about breaking the 'production ready' program in the master line.
